MCPBukkit
=========

An MCP converted version of http://github.com/CraftBukkit/CraftBukkit

This exists purely for reference purposes, other MCP driven projects such as MinecraftForge and FML will be using this to
reference CraftBukkit in an MCP compatible manner. It should be possible to auto-build this whenever CraftBukkit performs
a commit.
